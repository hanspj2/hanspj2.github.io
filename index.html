                          <h2>Week 1-4</h2>
                            <p>The start of this project began with continuing on my work from the previous semester on the gaze reactive keyboard. This was the starting point.
                            </p>
                            <div class="text-center">
                                <img src="RedesignedKeyboardFullscreen.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                            </div>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Last semester I was working alone on the keyboard but this time I was paired up with Claire. For the first few weeks most of our work 
                                was done via pair programming so all the commits are only representative of whose workstation we were using. During this time we managed
                                to get quite a bit done. We redesigned the layout to make it look sleeker and more integrated with the rest of the program. We implemented
                                dynamic sizing of the keyboard to allow display on any resolution. We reworked some of the underlying code to allow easier implementation 
                                of additional keyboard layouts, added aditional keyboard layouts and added a shift button that will also switch keyboards layouts. 
                                After a while we were able to divide up and work on individual smaller things related to the keyboard and the program as a whole.
                                We got the scroll button deactivating properly, the colors of the buttons resetting correctly in the main program (this required some small changes to the StateManger) and other small but 
                                necessary fixes before we put out a release. The new keyboard was merged with the new state manager. There were also various small bugfixes 
                                to do with the keyboard like focus issues, font scaling and buttons not working correctly that were fixed.
                            </p>
                            <p>This is the keyboard in its current state nearing a release (Font sizing is not final).
                            </p>
                            <div class="text-center">

                            <p></p>
                            <p>In week 3 we began preparing for what we will do after the keyboard is in a releasable state. David wanted a demo-able gaze reactive
                                application for guests to use as there is not a lot of immediately demo-able software for guests touring the polytechnic. 
                                This application would be an information portal displaying various information about the polytechnic that you would basically navigate 
                                through using the gaze tracking software. Claire and I began brainstorming additional ideas for this application that involved ideas
                                such as games and other things. There were also ideas for 
                                further improving the keyboard such as speech to text functionality that could be added on after we get an initial release out using 
                                the in-house keyboard. Supporting the overall software package more with bug fixes and quality of life features was also discussed(
                                some bugs discussed have since been fixed as detailed above).  
                            </p>
							
							<h2>Week 5-8</h2>
							<p>Week five was mostly us trying to figure out how to create a new installer in visual studio. This turned out to be more difficult than
							expected as it is not natively supported by visual studio and required some add-ons that are less then ideally documented. After an amount
							of work Claire and I got it working and have submitted a copy of it to David for review before finalizing a release (Note: the installer
							submitted is not final, it does not include shortcuts and proper naming). Since the process of creating an installer was somewhat
							troublesome we intend to document the process we used to make it easier in the future.</p>
							
							<p>With the keyboard largely finished for now and the final steps on hold while David reviews the installer, Claire moved onto creating
							the demo while I decided I would take a look at the dynamic zoom issue. I manged to make some progress, I was able to get a smooth zoom
							happening but it was on a single point and not using the eye tracking. It became apparent that the issue was fairly complicated and it
							appeared the issue may be at least partially with the “Karna Magnification” software and would require more time to fix then I initially
							hoped. I did have several ideas to fix the dynamic zoom issue that I would be interested in trying to implement in the future. During 
							this time I was also assisting Claire in getting the initial setup for the demo done with gaze interactive buttons and forms.</p>
							
							<p>Since the dynamic zoom was a bit of a non-starter I moved onto helping Claire with the demo.  I took over the central part of the demo
							with the basic pages displaying information about the polytechnic while Claire moved onto some more interesting side projects related to
							the demo. Out of personal preference I scrapped a small amount of the existing work on the demo that opted for multiple forms and shifted
							to a using multiple panels instead. This was simpler for me and followed the coding style of the GazeToolbar more closely, hopefully
							letting people who might work on these in the future an easier time of understanding it. Work on this was fairly quick and simple; the 
							core of the demo is almost complete with the only few steps left being to read in the actual information, potential additional features
							and design choices. </p>
