                          <h2>Week 1-4</h2>
                            <p>The start of this project began with continuing on my work from the previous semester on the gaze reactive keyboard. This was the starting point.
                            </p>
                            <div class="text-center">

                            </div>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Last semester I was working alone on the keyboard but this time I was paired up with Claire. For the first few weeks most of our work 
                                was done via pair programming so all the commits are only representative of whose workstation we were using. During this time we managed
                                to get quite a bit done. We redesigned the layout to make it look sleeker and more integrated with the rest of the program. We implemented
                                dynamic sizing of the keyboard to allow display on any resolution. We reworked some of the underlying code to allow easier implementation 
                                of additional keyboard layouts, added aditional keyboard layouts and added a shift button that will also switch keyboards layouts. 
                                After a while we were able to divide up and work on individual smaller things related to the keyboard and the program as a whole.
                                We got the scroll button deactivating properly, the colors of the buttons resetting correctly in the main program (this required some small changes to the StateManger) and other small but 
                                necessary fixes before we put out a release. The new keyboard was merged with the new state manager. There were also various small bugfixes 
                                to do with the keyboard like focus issues, font scaling and buttons not working correctly that were fixed.
                            </p>
                            <p>This is the keyboard in its current state nearing a release (Font sizing is not final).
                            </p>
                            <div class="text-center">
                                <img src="ReRedesignedKeyboard.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                            </div>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>In week 3 we began preparing for what we will do after the keyboard is in a releasable state. David wanted a demo-able gaze reactive
                                application for guests to use as there is not a lot of immediately demo-able software for guests touring the polytechnic. 
                                This application would be an information portal displaying various information about the polytechnic that you would basically navigate 
                                through using the gaze tracking software. Claire and I began brainstorming additional ideas for this application that involved ideas
                                such as games and other things. There were also ideas for 
                                further improving the keyboard such as speech to text functionality that could be added on after we get an initial release out using 
                                the in-house keyboard. Supporting the overall software package more with bug fixes and quality of life features was also discussed(
                                some bugs discussed have since been fixed as detailed above).
