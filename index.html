                          <h2>Week 1-4</h2>
                            <p>The start of this project began with continuing on my work from the previous semester on the gaze reactive keyboard. This was the starting point.
                            </p>
                            <div class="text-center">
                                <img src="RedesignedKeyboardFullscreen.PNG" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                            </div>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Last semester I was working alone on the keyboard but this time I was paired up with Claire. For the first few weeks most of our work 
                                was done via pair programming so all the commits are only representative of whose workstation we were using. During this time we managed
                                to get quite a bit done. We redesigned the layout to make it look sleeker and more integrated with the rest of the program. We implemented
                                dynamic sizing of the keyboard to allow display on any resolution. We reworked some of the underlying code to allow easier implementation 
                                of additional keyboard layouts, added aditional keyboard layouts and added a shift button that will also switch keyboards layouts. 
                                After a while we were able to divide up and work on individual smaller things related to the keyboard and the program as a whole.
                                We got the scroll button deactivating properly, the colors of the buttons resetting correctly in the main program (this required some small changes to the StateManger) and other small but 
                                necessary fixes before we put out a release. The new keyboard was merged with the new state manager. There were also various small bugfixes 
                                to do with the keyboard like focus issues, font scaling and buttons not working correctly that were fixed.
                            </p>
                            <p>This is the keyboard in its current state nearing a release (Font sizing is not final).
                            </p>
                            <div class="text-center">

                            <p></p>
                            <p>In week 3 we began preparing for what we will do after the keyboard is in a releasable state. David wanted a demo-able gaze reactive
                                application for guests to use as there is not a lot of immediately demo-able software for guests touring the polytechnic. 
                                This application would be an information portal displaying various information about the polytechnic that you would basically navigate 
                                through using the gaze tracking software. Claire and I began brainstorming additional ideas for this application that involved ideas
                                such as games and other things. There were also ideas for 
                                further improving the keyboard such as speech to text functionality that could be added on after we get an initial release out using 
                                the in-house keyboard. Supporting the overall software package more with bug fixes and quality of life features was also discussed(
                                some bugs discussed have since been fixed as detailed above).  
                            </p>
							
							<h2>Week 5-8</h2>
							<p>Week five was mostly us trying to figure out how to create a new installer in visual studio. This turned out to be more difficult than
							expected as it is not natively supported by visual studio and required some add-ons that are less then ideally documented. After an amount
							of work Claire and I got it working and have submitted a copy of it to David for review before finalizing a release (Note: the installer
							submitted is not final, it does not include shortcuts and proper naming). Since the process of creating an installer was somewhat
							troublesome we intend to document the process we used to make it easier in the future.</p>
							
							<p>With the keyboard largely finished for now and the final steps on hold while David reviews the installer, Claire moved onto creating
							the demo while I decided I would take a look at the dynamic zoom issue. I manged to make some progress, I was able to get a smooth zoom
							happening but it was on a single point and not using the eye tracking. It became apparent that the issue was fairly complicated and it
							appeared the issue may be at least partially with the “Karna Magnification” software and would require more time to fix then I initially
							hoped. I did have several ideas to fix the dynamic zoom issue that I would be interested in trying to implement in the future. During 
							this time I was also assisting Claire in getting the initial setup for the demo done with gaze interactive buttons and forms.</p>
							
							<p>Since the dynamic zoom was a bit of a non-starter I moved onto helping Claire with the demo.  I took over the central part of the demo
							with the basic pages displaying information about the polytechnic while Claire moved onto some more interesting side projects related to
							the demo. Out of personal preference I scrapped a small amount of the existing work on the demo that opted for multiple forms and shifted
							to a using multiple panels instead. This was simpler for me and followed the coding style of the GazeToolbar more closely, hopefully
							letting people who might work on these in the future an easier time of understanding it. Work on this was fairly quick and simple; the 
							core of the demo is almost complete with the only few steps left being to read in the actual information, potential additional features
							and design choices. </p>
							
							<p>Below is a few screenshots of the demo in its current state, it is missing the actual information, the color scheme/design is not final
              and the image on the home screen is not currently dynamically sized making it too big for the small screen I took the screenshots on.</p>

                  <img src="Screenshot (1).png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

              <p></p>

              <div class="text-center">

                            </div>
                            
                </div>

              <h2>Week 9</h2>
              <p>
              I cleaned up some parts of the dynamic zoom from the GazeToolbar as it was clear we weren’t going to be able to get it working for a release. Since there were parts of the UI that still referenced the dynamic zoom these had to be removed from the settings page. This was more difficult than it should have been as the setting page is a bit of a mess we inherited from whoever made it. Simply removing a button would create odd cascading failures that were a bit nonsensical.
              </p>
              <h2>Week 10</h2>
              <p>
                  The feedback received about the installer wasn’t great. The tool we were using to create the installer was pretty basic and had limitations about what it could do. We decided a new installer tool was needed and so we looked online for what would best fit our needs for the GazeToolbar. We ended up settling on WiX. WiX is a popular and well documented toolset for creating windows installers and has extensions for various versions of visual studio. The general opinion online about WiX is that it is a powerful tool that is able to do a lot but can be a little complex to learn. During this week we managed to get a basic installer up and running using WiX but still need to get it working exactly the way we want. Some things we are looking to include are 

                  
                  
                      <br>Shortcuts for desktop/programs menu <br>
                      Can uninstall <br>
                      Icons <br>
                      More dialogue menus during installer <br>
                      Correct install location <br>
  
                  

                  These are very basic but some of the constraints of the old installer we were using was that it was difficult to customise the installation dialogues and some of the finer details about the install location.
                  
                  Some other feedback received was that the default fixation lengths were off and should be adjusted. 
                  There was also quirk where the saved settings would not be loading into the program until the settings page was opened. This was fixed by adding the settings page to a load order of the programs start up.
                  
              </p>
              <h2>Week 11</h2>
              <p>
                  At the start of this week we were testing the Toolbar and discovered that if you use the mouse click events generated by the toolbar on the inbuilt keyboard you could encounter bugs that were very annoying. Using the mouse on the keyboard isn’t something you would normally do but if you accidently did it some of the bugs were difficult to break out of and would be very intrusive to the use of the toolbar. We needed to fix this, but instead of fixing the bug itself it was easier to avoid the use case entirely and add a neat feature at the same time. What we ended up doing is modifying the Toolbar so that when a mouse click is selected on the Toolbar the keyboard is automatically hidden and when the mouse click event is over the keyboard is redisplayed to the screen. This gives the user more screen real-estate to select items and functionally removes the bug from the program. The implementation of this required some modifications to the state manager and an additional system flag. It should be noted that the bug still exists but in the programs current state cannot be encountered. 

                  The new installer was changed to include a default settings file. By default the Toolbar installs to program files so if you do not run the program as admin you do not have write permissions to the folder. The Toolbar looks for a settings file and if it doesn’t find one will create its own, this created an issue where a settings file could not be created after a fresh install and the Toolbar would not run. To fix this we simply added a settings file with default values to the installer.
                  
                  During this week I also added some information to the demo software.
                  
              </p>
              <h2>Week 12</h2>
              <p>
                  This week was more work on the installer trying to implement the features we wanted for it. 
                  There was also a bug where the keyboard hiding that was implemented in the previous week was not remembering its position (the keyboard can be anchored to the top or bottom of the screen). This was fixed fairly simply. 
                  
                  I also added some more information and pictures to the demo.
                  
              </p>
              <h2>Week 13</h2>
              <p>
                  David had some more feedback for us based on our current progress with the Toolbar. There were many features in the settings menu that had carried over from previous peoples work on the Toolbar that were either broken or now unnecessary that should be fixed or removed. David was also encountering a persistent bug where when the keyboard was onscreen the toolbar options on the right of the screen would become unresponsive.

                  For the broken or unnecessary features Claire and I went to work going through and removing what was just broken and fixing what we could in a short amount of time. With the end of the project coming up David wanted to push out a release and so we didn’t spend a lot of time trying to fix things that would be very time consuming. Some features like sticky left click were broken and somewhat unusual as a feature anyway so we removed them. Others like restore default settings were not working but were able to be fixed quickly so we fixed what we could.
                  
                  For the persistent bug David was encountering we were unable to find the cause of this. Since we were unable to replicate the bug on any of the machines we tested the software on it made debugging the issue very difficult. We opted instead due to time pressure implement a workaround for the issue that lets you close the keyboard with a “close” button place on the keyboard itself, this is not ideal but without the ability to replicate the bug trying to fix it was a very slow process.
                  
              </p>

              <h2>Week 14</h2>
              <p>
                  It turned out the fix for the settings file in week 11 had its own issues. Without the ability to write to the programs folder the program would now still run but you were unable to save your settings. At David’s suggestion the settings file was moved to appdata/roaming where the program would have write permissions on the settings file. The keyboard was also adjusted so the spacebar is in the middle bottom of the keyboard.

                  For the demo after receiving feedback from several people and issues getting it to work ideally we changed the way it was structured. Now instead of selecting buttons with your gaze to navigate the individual pages you select the category with your gaze and scroll through one large page with all of the information on it. This allows people to see multiple features of the eye tracking software and makes designing the pages easier. Claire also created a simpler version of her paint program at Adon’s suggestion to demo individually as a separate program form the demo.
                  
              </p>

              <h2>Week 15</h2>
              <p>
                  With this week being essentially the final working week Claire and I attempted to tie up as many loose ends as possible and push a release of the software. David’s persistent bug was still unresolved but we cleaned up the workaround. Instead of a clunky close button on the keyboard, the potentially unresponsive buttons on the Toolbar have a second identical button layer on top of them by the keyboard that mimic the original buttons. This is not ideal but due to the nature of the bug and our inability to replicate it this was the best workaround we could come up with to get the software to a releasable state.

                  The installer was essentially completed to the point where we are happy with it
                  
                  
                  <br><s>Shortcuts for desktop/programs menu</s><br>
                    <s>Can uninstall</s><br>
                    <s>Icons</s><br>
                    <s>More dialogue menus during installer</s><br>
                    <s>Correct install location</s><br>

                  
                  
                  With all of the above features completed David was happy enough with the Toolbar to release a new version of it, so we generated the release and pushed it up https://github.com/accessibilitysoftwarehub/OpenSourceWindowsGazeControl/releases/tag/2.0
